# Feed Reader Testing

## Overview

This project is a web-based application that reads RSS feeds. As a part of Udacity's Front-End NanoDegree(FEND) program, Udacity provides me a pre-existing application. And I wrote a number of tests(_feedreader.js_) against this application. These will test the underlying business logic of the application as well as the event handling and DOM manipulation.

## Getting started

- Download ZIP file.
- Open index.html file on your brower.
- On the bottom of the page, you can check out the result of tests including 7 specs. All tests will pass initially, so all specs looks green.

## What I learned

- Basic TDD(Test-Driven Development) skills
- Writing effective tests using [Jasmine](https://jasmine.github.io/)
- Analyzing an application including the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
